# chatbot
Third year AI project for an introductory course at Ontario Tech. This project uses the popular Anaconda distribution of Python.

#Course's evaluation for the project:
*1.* Task definition: is the task precisely defined and is the motivation clear? does the world
somehow become a better place if your project were successful?
*2.* Approach: did you describe the used methods clearly, with good justification, and testing?
*3.* Data and experiments: have you explained the data clearly, performed systematic experiments,
and reported concrete results?
*4.* Analysis: did you interpret the results and try to explain why things worked (or didn't work) the
way they did? Do you show concrete examples?
*5.* Extra credit: does the project present interesting and novel ideas (i.e., would this be publishable
at a good conference)?
